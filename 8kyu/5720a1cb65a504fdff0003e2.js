// Find the Difference in Age between Oldest and Youngest Family Members

// At the annual family gathering, the family likes to find the oldest living family memberâ€™s age and the youngest family memberâ€™s age and calculate the difference between them.

// You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed 'age' of 0. Return a new array (a tuple in Python) with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age].


function differenceInAges(ages){

    let newArray = []

    let sort = ages.sort((a,b) => a - b)
    // console.log(sort)
    
    let youngest = sort[0]
    // console.log(youngest)
    newArray.push(youngest)
    
    let oldest = sort[sort.length - 1]
    // console.log(oldest)
    newArray.push(oldest)
    
    let difference = oldest - youngest
    // console.log(difference)
    newArray.push(difference)

    return newArray;

}

console.log(differenceInAges([82, 15, 6, 38, 35]));
// [6, 82, 76]
console.log(differenceInAges([57, 99, 14, 32]));
// [14, 99, 85]


// Solution 1
function differenceInAges (ages) {

    let max = Math.max(...ages),
        min = Math.min(...ages)
        diff = max - min
        
    return [min, max, diff]
}

// Solution 2
function differenceInAges(ages){
    const min = Math.min(...ages);
    const max = Math.max(...ages);
    
    return [min, max, max-min];
}

// Solution 3
const differenceInAges = (ages) => {
    let youngest = Math.min.apply(null, ages);
    let oldest = Math.max.apply(null, ages);
    return [youngest, oldest, oldest - youngest];
};


// Solution 5
function differenceInAges(ages){
    return [Math.min(...ages),Math.max(...ages),Math.max(...ages)-Math.min(...ages)]

// Solution 6
const differenceInAges = a => (min = Math.min(...a),max = Math.max(...a),[min,max,max-min])const differenceInAges = a => (min = Math.min(...a),max = Math.max(...a),[min,max,max-min])


// Solution 8
function differenceInAges(ages){
    let x = ages.sort((a,b) => a - b)[0]
    let y = ages.sort((a,b) => a - b)[ages.length - 1]
