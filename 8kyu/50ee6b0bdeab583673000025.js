// Basic variable assignment

// This code should store "codewa.rs" as a variable called name but it's not working. Can you figure out why?

// var a == "code";
// var b == "wa.rs";
// var name == a + b;

var a = "code";
var b = "wa.rs";
var name = a + b;

// Solution 1
var a = "code";
var b = "wa.rs";
var name = a + b;


// Solution 2
var a = "code",
    b = "wa.rs",
    name = a + b;
